    "\n",
    "To improve performance we explore 2 different avenues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How the text data is represented. Specifically we use word embeddings.\n",
    "2. What type of model is used to learn the relationships between embeddings and the target feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically for part 1, the following word embedding schemes are explored:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Word2Vec - pretrained\n",
    "2. Word2Vec - corpus trained\n",
    "\n",
    "For part 2, based on the results of <a href=\"https://github.com/MIDS-W207/coursework/blob/master/Readings/Week%2008/An%20Empirical%20Comparison%20of%20Supervised%20Learning%20Algorithms.pdf\">this</a> paper comparing the performance of classifiers, we try out the following 3 classifiers:\n",

    "## Pre-Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are using Word Embeddings, we'll need to standardize the format of the input tweets. From the creators of the dataset there is a <a href=\"https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/preprocess-twitter.rb\">Ruby script</a>, which has been converted to <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/amackcrane/python-version-of-glove-twitter-preprocess-script\">Python</a> by a Kaggle user. The below method is adapted from this Python version, with some additional changes to improve the number of input words which can be embedded. Some of these changes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Removing most punctuation entirely. The original Kaggle script leaves a lot of punctation untouched, so that for example the quoted word `'something'` would be included as a separate feature to the unquoted word `something`. We make the assumption that such differences in punctuation of features are unlikely to be significant in identifying disaster tweets.\n",
    "2. Fixing a couple of bugs with the way whitespace was added around certain punctuation marks, such as `.,`\n",
    "3. Add spaces around inserted tags such as ` <number> `\n",
    "\n",
    "Making the above changes to the preprocessor we increase the number of input words which are found in the embedding vocabulary from ~75% to nearly 90%.\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting decision in the preprocessing script is to remove tagged twitter usernames (i.e. strings starting with `@`), since you might expect that this could provide some useful information in trying to predict the nature of the tweets. For example, a tweet tagging a local fire department might be much more likely to be a disaster related tweet. However on searching the word embedding features for well known Twitter usernames (e.g. `@realdonaldtrump`) we find that they are not present, so this seems to accord with the processing done for the Glove word embeddings."
